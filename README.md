# Pi Cloud

A lightweight, modern **cloud storage system** with server-side **encryption** and **compression**, optimized for devices like the **Raspberry Pi**.  
The file processing is powered by native **C++ algorithms from the FileInSight project**, integrated as a DLL for maximum efficiency and data security.

---

## Features

- **User System** User completely own files, and can restrict acces via other Users
- **File uploads & downloads** via a clean, modern web interface  
- **Server-side encryption & compression** using FileInSight algorithms (C++ -> DLL via JNA)  
- **File management** – upload, download, delete, view metadata  
- **Smart file handling** with MIME type detection and custom icons  
- **Responsive UI** – pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework needed)  
- **Spring Boot + JPA backend** for persistent file management

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Backend | Spring Boot (REST, JPA) |
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS |
| Database | H2 / SQLite / PostgreSQL (configurable) |
| Native Module | FileInSight C++ DLL (encryption & compression) |
| Bridge | Java Native Access (JNA) |
| Target Platform | Raspberry Pi / Linux / Windows |

## Server-Side Encryption & Compression

- **AES-based file encryption**
- **FileInSight compression (LZ77/TLSH-inspired)**
- **On-the-fly processing** Encrypted and Compressed files will be downloaded via temporary link, so serverside files will stay encrypted the whole time
- **Byte-Stream Security Check** Files will be checked before adding them to disk
- **Shannon Entropy** Files with lower entropy then a treshhold will be compressed while uploading
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Requires FileInSight Lib-Build)

**Benefits:**  
- No dependency on Java's crypto libraries  
- Higher performance via native execution  
- Secure key management outside the JVM  
- Configurable Settings: File size, Storage path, forbidden types, key hashing-iterations (encryption), Compression level

## Installation & Setup

### 🔹 Requirements

- Java 17+  
- Maven or Gradle  
- (Optional) Node.js / Vite for frontend development  
- Compiled `FileInSight.dll` (or `.so` on Linux)  
- Raspberry Pi OS / Windows / Linux x64  

### 🔹 Run

```bash
# 1. Build the project
mvn clean package

# 2. Start the server
java -jar target/pi-cloud.jar

# 3. Open in browser
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Frontend Features

- Dynamic file listing using 
- File preview before upload  
- MIME-type-based file icons  
- Responsive design with dark mode support  
- Smooth button animations for uploads/downloads  

---

## Development Mode (Frontend Separation)

For faster frontend development without restarting Spring Boot:

```bash
# 1. Run backend
mvn spring-boot:run

# 2. Run frontend separately (e.g., using Vite or Live Server)
npm install
npm run dev
```

> The frontend communicates with the backend via `/api/*` proxy routes.

---

## Deployment (Raspberry Pi)

1. Copy `FileInSight.so` to `/usr/local/lib/`  
2. Run `pi-cloud.jar`  
3. Configure autostart using `systemd` or `crontab`
